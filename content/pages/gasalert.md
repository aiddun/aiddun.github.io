I made a small site to text you when etherium gas prices (fees for transactions on the etherium blockchain), a problem I had, as well as to better understand price trends. 

My main goal with this project was to get better at planning, designing, and executing very high quality, highly intuitive user interfaces for complex tasks. While I am proud of what I build, I also believe this could be so much better and even more intuitive and I plan on releasing a better version in the future. 

This was also a great excersise in getting better with the relationship with product vision and actual user feedback. I originally thought that I had designed the most intuitive user interface possible for this problem and originally quick to defend my decisions come critiques, but eventually realized that I was wrong and one of my assumption was faulty (namely that I had raised the knowledge ceiling slightly too high in designing under the assumption that all users knew how gas worked and falsely thinking my design solved that problem, which was wrong. Overall, learned a ton!

I made a small site to text you when etherium gas prices (fees for transactions on the etherium blockchain), a problem I had, as well as to better understand price trends. 

My main goal with this project was to get better at planning, designing, and executing very high quality, highly intuitive user interfaces for a complex task. While I am proud of what I built, I also believe this could be so much better and even more intuitive and I plan on releasing a better version in the future. 

This was a great excersise in getting better with the relationship with product vision and actual user feedback. I originally thought that I had designed the most intuitive user interface I could for this problem and was quick to defend my decisions come critique, but eventually realized that I was wrong and one of my assumptions was faulty (namely that I had raised the knowledge ceiling slightly too high, falsely thinking my design would be intuitive to everyone including people who didn't know how gas worked, but was wrong. I think if you spend a lot of time thinking about a UI it eventually becomes very intuitive *to you*, and you always need to be alert to and try to work around that bias, which sometimes can be really hard.  Overall, learned a ton!

Frustrated by how hard it is to communicate properly with covid, I built a very casual, ephemeral positional audio chat channel. 

You can find it at https://tinytown.to

The first version was very unoptimized and crashed when tried with a group of 50 people. Hopefully this version, with a webgl2 rendering engine and other cool things under the hood, will be better!i

Stack: Custom webGL2 game engine (w/ PixiJS), React, Next, Tailwind, Agora Audio, backend using Express, SocketIO, hosted on Google Cloud.

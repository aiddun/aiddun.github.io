#### About me:
I'm a sophomore CS major at UT Austin in the Turing Scholars honors program. I'm currently on a half-gap semester, and am interning at Microsoft on Azure this summer. I went to Bronx Science for high school. I'm interested in making cool, innovative stuff, product development, robotics, snow cones, and a bunch more.

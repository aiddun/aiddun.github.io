#### About me:
I'm currently interning at Microsoft on Azure, specifically the Avere HPC Cache team. I'm a CS major at UT Austin in the Turing Scholars honors program. I went to Bronx Science for high school. I'm interested in making cool, innovative stuff, product development, robotics, snow cones, and a bunch more.

#### Snow Cones!

The summer of 2019, I worked as a camp counselor at a small arts camp in Maine called Camp Med-O-Lark.

One class block, I thought it would be fun if I tried to teach a class on snow cones. So, I developed a curriculum where we tried making a new flavor every class, often making recipes up from scratch. It was really, really fun, with the class filling up super early by the second time it was offered. I hope to keep up this experimentation here!

Here are all of the flavors I/we've made so far. We used fresh ingredients for all fruit/vegetable flavors:

-   Kool-Aid (4 different types, all good)
-   Lemon(ade)
-   Fresh mango
-   Coconut
-   Mint
-   Cucumber
-   Kiwi
-   Broccoli (do not recommend)
-   Condensed milk (Taiwanese)
-   Maple Syrup
-   Banana
-   Blueberry
-   Strawberry
-   Raspberry

**Current favorite:** Mint!
